## Installation

designing.ggplots is an R package that will install the workshop
materials for “Designing ggplots: making clear figures that
communicate”. This workshop will take place at the Southern California
All-Hands R Users Meetup, Nov. 23, Warner Bros, Burbank, CA. Installing
this package will also install all the R packages we might need for the
workshop.

You can install designing.ggplots from this repository with

``` r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("malcolmbarrett/designing.ggplots")
```

Once you’ve installed the package, download the workshop materials with

``` r
designing.ggplots::install_workshop("path/to/your/computer")
```

Replace “path/to/your/computer” with where on your computer you want the
workshop installed.
